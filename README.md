### Python Small Projects & Games

Welcome to my collection of small Python projects! This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly Python programs, ranging from basic programming exercises to fun and simple games.
These projects are fornew Python developers learn and practice core concepts, while also providing a fun way to get hands-on experience with coding.

## Projects Overview
This repository includes the following types of projects:
**Basic Python exercises**: Simple code examples focusing on basic Python concepts like variables, loops, functions, and conditionals.
**Mini games**: Fun Python projects like text-based games, graphical games using libraries like Rock paper scissors, and interactive command-line games.
**Small utilities and scripts**: Useful scripts that automate tasks, such as simple calculators or random number generators.

## List of Projects
 **Number Guessing Game**: A simple console-based number guessing game that allows the user to guess a number within a given range.
 **Rock, Paper, Scissors**: A console-based game where the user plays rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
 **Simple Calculator**: A command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
 **Guess the Word (Hangman)**: A simple word-guessing game where the user has to guess the correct word before running out of attempts.
 
## Getting Started
To get started with these projects, follow the steps below:
### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Jasbirkaur27/Python.git
### 2. Install Python

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can verify your Python installation by running:

python3 --version

### 3. Install Dependencies (If any)

Some projects may require external libraries such as **pandas** or **tkinter**. You can install these dependencies using `pip`. For example:
```bash
pip install tkinter
```
For graphical games or projects using external libraries, make sure you have the required libraries installed before running the script.

Happy Coding! ðŸ˜Š
